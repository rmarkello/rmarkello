### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a data engineer at [Komodo Health](https://www.octavebio.com/) where I develop pipelines for processing and analyzing healthcare data at scale.

I was previously a data engineer at [Octave](https://www.octavebio.com/) where I created data infrastructure and tooling for ingestion, processing, and analysis of multimodal clinical data to support precision healthcare for patients with multiple sclerosis.
I received my PhD at the [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/home) in the [Network Neuroscience Lab](https://netneurolab.github.io), where my work focused on understanding how different choices made during the research process can have outsize impact on scientific outcomes.

In my spare time Iâ€™ve developed some software designed to make doing research easier, like [`abagen`](https://github.com/rmarkello/abagen) (a toolbox for working with data from the [Allen Human Brain Atlas](https://human.brain-map.org/)) and [`snfpy`](https://github.com/rmarkello/snfpy) (a toolbox for performing similarity network fusion on multimodal data).
Feel free to drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rossdavism) if you want to chat!
