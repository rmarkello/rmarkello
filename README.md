### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a data engineer at [1m](https://www.1mplatform.com), where I oversee all things data for our healthcare risk management platform.

I was previously at [Komodo Health](https://www.komodohealth.com/) and [Octave](https://www.octavebio.com/), where I worked on data pipelines for processing and analyzing healthcare data at scale.
Before that I received my PhD in Neuroscience at the [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/home), where I developed software designed to make doing research easier like [`abagen`](https://github.com/rmarkello/abagen) (a toolbox for working with data from the [Allen Human Brain Atlas](https://human.brain-map.org/)) and [`neuromaps`](https://github.com/netneurolab/neuromaps) (a toolbox for analyzing brain imaging data).

Feel free to drop me a line on [LinkedIn]([https://twitter.com/rossdavism](https://linkedin.com/in/rossmarkello)) if you want to chat!
