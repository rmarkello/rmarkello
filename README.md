### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD candidate at the [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/home) working in the [@netneurolab](https://github.com/netneurolab). My research focuses on developing and applying statistical techniques to large-scale neuroscience datasets. In particular, Iâ€™m interested in seeing how choices that neuroscientists make during the research process impact their statistical results and inferences.

I also have a passion for developing software that makes it easier for scientists to do their work, like [`abagen`](https://github.com/rmarkello/abagen) (a toolbox for working with data from the [Allen Human Brain Atlas](https://human.brain-map.org/)) and [`snfpy`](https://github.com/rmarkello/snfpy) (a toolbox for performing similarity network fusion on multimodal data).
