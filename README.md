### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data engineer at [Octave](https://www.octavebio.com/), where I develop data infrastructure and tooling for ingestion, processing, and analysis of multimodal clinical data to support precision healthcare for patients with multiple sclerosis.

I previously earned my PhD at the [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/home) working in the [@netneurolab](https://github.com/netneurolab), where my work focused on understanding how different choices made during the research process can have outsize impact on scientific outcomes.

In my spare time Iâ€™ve developed some software designed to make doing research easier, like [`abagen`](https://github.com/rmarkello/abagen) (a toolbox for working with data from the [Allen Human Brain Atlas](https://human.brain-map.org/)) and [`snfpy`](https://github.com/rmarkello/snfpy) (a toolbox for performing similarity network fusion on multimodal data).

Feel free to drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rossdavism) if you want to chat!
